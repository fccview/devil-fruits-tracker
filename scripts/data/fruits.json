The user simply has to squeeze and twist the chosen target (akin to wringing out a soaked cloth) to extract liquid from them. Notably, she requires physical contact to squeeze them, posing a problem if her target is particularly fast. The wringing itself does not seem to cause any physical damage, no matter how severe, and actually seems to even bring a pleasurable sensation rather than a painful one. However, living beings that are wrung out this way still suffer from dangerous dehydration, and can be left as thoroughly shriveled pale husks.",
